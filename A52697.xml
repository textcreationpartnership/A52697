            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Therefore how requiſite is it (in this day) that a ſpirit of diſtinction (in God) go along with men in their ſeveral judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the work of God, that are ready to make themſelves judges of and over all that doth croſſe their opinions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions (in that way or form the mind is adicted to and ſet on), and a hardneſſe againſt all that cannot preſertly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to what man is ſo ready to ſet up; but let the ſpirit of ſound judgement and of a ſound mind weigh the matter (in this particular), and let men be quiet until God ariſe to be Judge of the controverſie, and the fierce and high will then be bowed down (to the foot of God), and the bitter aſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and allayed, and all will be cool, and in good order; for I am ſencible the tempter hath got ground (in this day) over the conditions of many, in whom God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a good work; &amp; had I not firſt read at home, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſeen abroad.</p>
            <p>And thus much I know, and am made ſencible of, that to terrifie people with words and exclamations and out cryes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any ſin and offence to Gods ſpirit, that doth not reach Gods witneſſe (wherein the way to eſcape the evil and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as well as the danger it ſelf is ſhewn) doth become a vain bable in this day of God, and at beſt can but make ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for wrath; for though the creature of God may and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58000:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doth ſuffer in that part which hath been tempted to folly and vanity of this world (in ſin and offence to Gods ſpirit); yet is not he the ſinner and offender againſt Gods ſpirit, that with his mind doth ſerve the Law of God (though he may have that part wherein dwels and rules (in the members) that which hath overpowered the whole man in the acting &amp; committing of ſin, and with his fleſh hath ſerved the Law thereof); but in the miſplacing of the mind, the tempter hath entred, and the temptation prevailed, to the bringing that in him, and him (in that) into and under the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the enemies work, that hath his delight chiefly and alone in God, and never have bent the minds delight after ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to and in the fleſh, and ſought opportunities to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ſame (though therein he hath been tempted by a Law in the members warring, &amp;c.)</p>
            <p>For which cauſe I may be hearkened to by the weak, and the poor may have an eye and ear well inclined (in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular), and a mind bended to my complaint, and ready to receive me in that which thinks and means well to all, and no ill to any: In that I have tryed many things, and have had a mind exerciſed in divers conditions (as well in the outward as inward), and in all conditions had learned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but no condition I have found like to that which is low, and poor, and mean, (in ſelfs eye); for in this I have been comforted under the power and pangs of death (when like a flood my ſoul was compaſſed about therewith), and the life of ſubmiſſion to the will of God, is that whereby I have known many fiery darts of Sathan quenched: And if any are tempted (in the particular before mentioned,) let them not conclude they are ſo tempted of God, but from their own hearts luſt, for God tempteth no man.</p>
            <p>But to the ground of life (in which the root ſtands, and from whence the tree ſprings) let all have an eye of reſpect, that hath brought forth what gives knowledge of good as well as evill, and evill as well as good; and while the fruit (that hath been taſted) is fed on by the mind made wiſe therein (as a God), the temptation needs muſt remain (with and in the man) and a neceſſity provoked in him that hath abuſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58000:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a ſtate of liberty and freedom of ſpirit (he at firſt was placed in); for the tree that God created (when he ſaw all that was made, to be good) may and doth tempt, in the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of what was ordained for his creatures tryall and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in that ſtate), though Gods will is the creatures preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation under the ſame: And let none be too confident in ſelfs work and approbation (in the firſt mans will, and that mans part), but let ſuch that think they ſtand, take heed leaſt they fall; and then the ſame meaſure hath been meeted to others, ſuch muſt expect from God, that come under the condemnation of the wicked, for ſuch need no other accuſer than <hi>Moſes,</hi> in whom they ſeem to truſt.</p>
            <p>Think not therefore I will accuſe thee to God (in theſe things), for one is judge that is neer thee (that doe ſuch things): For concerning the fiery tryals, they are manifeſt to the fleſh, in which we have great trouble on every hand (both within and without), though no temptation hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, but what was common to the Saints of old, and theſe things are ſuffered for the tryal of our faith in God, that on every ſide being ſpoken evil of, we might have great boldneſſe and confidence towards him, knowing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be with him; wherefo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For the time is come, that all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution: And when there was a ſuffering for evill-doing, we had our reward with men, and though we took their buffetings patiently, yet what glory had we therein; but hereunto are we now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of Chriſt, that for well-doing we alſo ſuffer patiently, knowing that this is good and acceptable with God, as he that was reviled, reviled not again, and when he ſuffered threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>What therefore ſhall I ſay to theſe things? if God be for us who can be againſt us? And if he ſpared not his own ſon, but freely gave him up for us all, ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> Seeing it is thankworthy, that for conſcience ſake we endure grief, and ſuffer wrongfully, that we may know how to behave our ſelves among the froward, as well as the gentle; and who is he that can harm us while we are followers of that which is good?</p>
            <p>Therefore will I lay no greater burden on any, than what is already borne, and of which the upright in heart is made judge, and to them that are under the temptation of the enemy I write theſe things, that they arm themſelves with patience in God, and be like minded in the truth, to him that is gone before: And the God of truth and peace preſerve the ſimple hearted to the end of this work, and in the end crown them with immortality in God.</p>
